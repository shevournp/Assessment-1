const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "2nd step:owner decide what the software or app will do in discussion.ex: log in/out/send email ect"
const designed = "3rd step: creating the designed by making decisions on how to implement the requirement.ex: choosing coding languages/libraries/frameworks to see which is best to user needs"
const implementation ="4step:coding the design inorder to publish it"
const testingInteration ="5th step:code is finish and testing the program to make sure it works and integration to make sure user can access the info easily."
const maintain = "6th step:adding new feature and updating feature over time to users needs."
